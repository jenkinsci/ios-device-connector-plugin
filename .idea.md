I don't quite understand how jenkins plugin's are made (looks confusing...)  but you guys seem to be itching for ideas on other ways to install the IPA's..

There is no issues page, so I will just post this in a a text file and make a pull request...  let me know if / how I can help...

This is just a shell script i use to install IPA's onto MY device...  it's jailbroken and I DO NOT have an Apple Developer account..  It uses the `installipa` executable available on cydia on the device..

I just use a self-signed codesign identity inside of xcode... and "Build for Running"

As a script phase of the target... I source the file with this script...

```shell
. ~/dotfiles/installonipad.sh
````

then call...

```shell
installonipad "${CODESIGNING_FOLDER_PATH}" | logger
```
```shell
installonipad(){

      IPAD=root@vpadmini.local   # local wifi address
   APPNAME=$(basename $1 .app)   # derives from arg1
INSTALLDIR=/var/mobile/Downloads # arbitrary folder
       IPA="$APPNAME.ipa"
  BUNDLEID=$(defaults read "$1/Info.plist" CFBundleIdentifier)  # uses defaults to read plist

    cd    	"$1/.."
    rm -r 	Payload # clean up
    rm -r 	"$IPA"
 mkdir -p 	Payload # ipa skeleton
    cp -r 	"$1" Payload/
   zip -r 	"$IPA" Payload #package
logger 		"IPA is $IPA bundleID is $BUDLEID"
   scp 		"$IPA" $IPAD:$INSTALLDIR/ # keys are already installed on dev machine / ipad
   ssh -Y 	$IPAD "installipa -f $INSTALLDIR/$IPA; open $BUNDLEID"
}
```

This does everything, in 0 steps, except open the app (and I think you can get a Cydia app that does that too!).

Hope this can be an inspiration or other motivation for new ways to do it.


PS.  I can't even figure out how to get a device to be listed with the plugin!  Needs some instructions.
